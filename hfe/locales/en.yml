# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  about:
    content1: Human Factors Engineering is “the scientific discipline concerned with the understanding of interactions among humans and other elements of a system, and the profession that applies theory, principles, data and methods to design in order to optimize human well-being and overall system performance.” (International Ergonomics Association)
    content2: The field is closely related with psychology, physiology, computer science, industrial design, biomechanics and anthropometry.
    content3: Human Factors Engineering track of UNIST aims to create a better tomorrow by designing products, systems and processes for people through science and engineering.

      lab_vision: “We aim to understand how we construct our perceived worlds.”
      lab_description: In Perception & Action Lab, we study 1) how the human perceptual system constructs vivid representations of the surrounding world from incomplete and noisy sensory signals, 2) how our sensory-motor system coordinates to generate efficient responses, and 3) how we can apply those knowledge to improve the quality…
    color:
      lab_name: Color Lab
      lab_full_name: Color & Affective Engineering Lab
      lab_vision: “Studying about human visual perception toward colors and images.”
      lab_description: The color science is a scientific discipline that deals with “color” we perceive. Main research interests are quantifying the visual perception such as color, texture and gloss, figuring out how those perceptions influence the human emotion (SamSung in Korean), and then applying those knowledge on the…
    dnce:
      lab_name: DNCE lab
      lab_full_name: Decision Neuroscience and Cognitive Engineering Laboratory
      lab_vision: “We aim to understand the neural and psychological foundations of valuation and decision-making in various social settings”
      lab_description: Decision Neuroscience and Cognitive Engineering laboratory use economic probes of behavior in conjunction with functional neuroimaging tools to characterize mechanisms by which the brain processes both social and non-social information. In addition, we leverage economic decision models of healthy individuals to investigate abnormal decision behaviors among individuals with psychopathology.
